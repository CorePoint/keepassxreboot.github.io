  <p>By verifying the signatures of KeePassXC releases you prove <strong>authenticity</strong> and <strong>integrity</strong> of the downloaded file.<br/>
    This means that the file you just downloaded was created by the KeePassXC Team (the signature was made by one of the KeePassXC maintainers)<br/>
     and that the contents of the file are exactly what the KeePassXC Team signed.<br/><br/>
     A more detailed article is available in the <a href="https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/verifying-signatures/">Qubes-OS project documentation</a>.

  <h4>Importing the Public Master Key</h4>
  <p>The KeePassXC public master key can be imported as follows</p>
  <strong>From a specific keyserver</strong>
  <pre><code>gpg --keyserver pool.sks-keyservers.net --recv-keys 0xBF5A669F2272CF4324C1FDA8CFB4C2166397D0D2</code></pre>
  <strong>Manual download from <a href="https://keepassxc.org/keepassxc_master_signing_key.asc">here</a> and import with gpg</strong>
  <pre><code>gpg --import ./keepassxc_master_signing_key.asc </code></pre>
  <strong>Fetch via gpg</strong>
  <pre><code>gpg --fetch-keys https://keepassxc.org/keepassxc_master_signing_key.asc</code></pre>
  <p>These are the fingerprints of the master key and the current signing sub keys:</p>
  <div><pre><code>pub   rsa4096/CFB4C2166397D0D2 2017-01-03 [SC]
      Key fingerprint = BF5A 669F 2272 CF43 24C1  FDA8 CFB4 C216 6397 D0D2
uid                 [  unknown  ] KeePassXC Release &lt;<span id="e0">release 'AT` keepassxc ^DOT' org</span>&gt;
sub   rsa2048/AFF235EEFB5A2517 2017-01-03 [S] [expires: 2019-01-03]
sub   rsa2048/D8538E98A26FD9C4 2017-01-03 [S] [expires: 2019-01-03]
sub   rsa2048/B7A66F03B59076A8 2017-01-03 [S] [expires: 2019-01-03]</code></pre>
  </div>
  <p>The full public master key can also be downloaded from the
    <a href="https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxreboot.github.io/blob/master/keepassxc_master_signing_key.asc">KeePassXC website repository</a> and the archives of the projectâ€™s
    <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/keepassx-reboot/PCfTw99W5aM">Google Group</a>.</p>
  </p>
  <h4>Verifying Releases</h4>
  <p>Every KeePassXC release is made of various files.<br/>
    A <code>.dmg</code> image for OS X, a <code>.zip</code> archive with binaries for Windows and a self-contained <code>.AppImage</code> for GNU/Linux and other platforms. There is also a cross-platform <code>.tar.bz2</code> source tarball.<br/>
    Each of these files has a <code>.sig</code> sidecar file containing a detached signature created with <strong>one of the release sub keys</strong>.<br/>
    <i>Note:</i> If you have trusted the master GPG key, the release sub keys are also trusted.<br/>
    You can verify the <strong>authenticity and integrity</strong> of a downloaded package using its detached signatures by running the following command:
    <pre><code>$ gpg -v --verify KeePassXC-$VERSION-x86_64.AppImage.sig KeePassXC-$VERSION-x86_64.AppImage
gpg: Signature made Sun 22 Jan 2017 06:32:45 PM CET
gpg:                using RSA key 71D4673D73C7F83C17DAE6A2D8538E98A26FD9C4
gpg: Good signature from "KeePassXC Release &lt;<span id="e1">release 'AT` keepassxc ^DOT' org</span>&gt;" [unknown]</code></pre>

    Additionally, there is a <code>.DIGEST</code> file that contains the SHA256 digest for each release file.<br/>
    You can verify the <strong>integrity</strong> of a package by comparing its hash digest with the following command:
    <pre><code>$ sha256sum -c KeePassXC-$VERSION-x86_64.AppImage.DIGEST
KeePassXC-$VERSION-x86_64.AppImage: OK</code></pre>
  </p>
