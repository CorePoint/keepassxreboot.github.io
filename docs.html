  <h3>FAQ</h3>
  <p class="faq"><span>Why KeePassXC instead of KeePassX?</span><br/>
    You can find the motivation behind our fork on the <a href="project">Project page</a>
  </p>
  <p class="faq"><span>Why KeePassXC instead of KeePass?</span><br/>
    KeePass is a nice password manager that works fine but it's developed in C# and requires Microsoft's .NET framework.<br/>
    Platforms beside Windows must use Wine or Mono instead, but this won't provide the native look and feel.<br/>
    KeePassXC, on the other hand, is developed in C++ with the Qt library and it is cross-platform.
  </p>
  <p class="faq"><span>Is Auto-Type supported on OS X or Windows?</span><br/>
    Yes, Auto-Type works cross-platform.
  </p>
  <p class="faq"><span>Which password database formats are compatible with KeePassXC?</span><br/>
  KeePassXC currently uses the KeePass 2.x (.kdbx) password database format as its native format.
  It can also import KeePass 1.x (.kdb) databases.
  </p>
  <p class="faq"><span>Why do I get an error when I try to build from source for this platform?</span><br/>
  Please follow every step on the <a href="https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc/wiki/Install-Instruction-from-Source">Wiki:Install-Instruction-from-Source</a> page
  </p>
  <p class="faq"><span>Why do the tray menu and in-app shortcuts not work on Ubuntu/Unity?</span><br/>
  This is a bug caused by the <code>appmenu-qt5</code> package.<br/>
  You have 3 options:<br/>
  <ol>
    <li>Remove the <code>appmenu-qt5</code> package</li>
    <li>Set the environment variable <code>UBUNTU_MENUPROXY=''</code></li>
    <li>Set the environment variable <code>QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME=''</code></li>
  </ol>
  <strong>Note:</strong> When you choose the first or third option, KeePassXC will lose the Unity look&amp;feel.
