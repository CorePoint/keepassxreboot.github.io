  <h6>What about KeePassHTTP?</h6>
  <p>KeePassXC does support KeePassHTTP for use with <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/passifox/">PassIFox</a> in Firefox and
  <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chromeipass/ompiailgknfdndiefoaoiligalphfdae">chromeIPass</a> in Google Chrome and Chromium. However, since the plugin in its current
  form offers <a href="https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc/issues/147">a few pitfalls</a> and we are very concerned about the safety of our users' passwords,
  we decided to not build it into the current main release. If need this feature, you can always download <a href="/download#source">the source code</a> and build it yourself with the CMake
  option <code>-DWITH_XC_HTTP=On</code>. We will reconsider adding the feature to the main release once we have
  <a href="https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc/issues/177#issuecomment-274582453"">fixed certain aspects</a>.
  <p><strong>Warning:</strong> If you decide to build KeePassXC yourself with KeePassHTTP support, please make sure that it only listens to <code>localhost</code> (<code>127.0.0.1</code>)
  and not to any network-routable interface and especially not to <code>0.0.0.0</code>!
