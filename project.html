    <div class="info">
        <h6>A note about KeePassHTTP</h6>
        <p>KeePassHTTP is not a highly secure protocol and has certain flaws which allow an attacker to decrypt your
            passwords if they manage to intercept communication between a KeePassHTTP server and PassIFox/chromeIPass over a
            network connection (see <a href="https://github.com/pfn/keepasshttp/issues/258">here</a> and <a
                    href="https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc/issues/147">here</a>). KeePassXC therefore strictly
            limits communication between itself and the browser plugin to your local computer. As long as your computer is
            not compromised, your passwords are fairly safe that way, but still use it at your own risk!

<div id="requirements">
    <h5>Requirements</h5>

    <p>KeePassXC has the following runtime requirements:

    <ul>
        <li>Qt5 (&gt;= 5.2): qtbase and qttools5
        <li>libgcrypt (&gt;= 1.6)
        <li>zlib
        <li>libxi, libxtst, qtx11extras (optional for Auto-Type on X11/Linux)
        <li>libyubikey,  libykpers-1 (optional for YubiKey support)
    </ul>

    <p>When using the AppImage or Snap Package release, these dependencies are already
        bundled with the application.

    <p>For building KeePassXC from source code, the following build-time dependencies are required:

    <ul>
        <li>make
        <li>cmake (&gt;= 2.8.12)
        <li>g++ (&gt;= 4.7) or clang++ (&gt;= 3.0)
